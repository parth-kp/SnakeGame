# SnakeGame


Abstract: Snake game is a computer action game, whose goal is to control a snake to move and collect food in a map.

The concept of Snake originated from the 1976 arcade game Blockade, developed by a British company called Gremlin Interactive, which shut down in 1984. Blockade was designed as a two-player game in which each would guide their own snakes, leaving a solid line behind them.
